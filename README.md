# Yet Another Covid Dashboard

A more interactive visual Application for inspecting current corona figures and the overall progression.
The [data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv) is pulled from Johns Hopkins University's [GitHub-Repositors](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) and visualized using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) which is a Python Wrapper/Framework for [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).
This is an extension to my original [Jupyter-Notebook](https://github.com/jmacenka/jupyternotebook_covid_19_visualization/blob/master/analysis_of_the_covid_19_course.ipynb) based analysis.

Feel free to fork, deploy or comment on :-)
